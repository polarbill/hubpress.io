| Inspiration | After Bill's first painting of I (Heart) Hugs, he has wanted to expand the concept with a larger canvas and more detailed work. Around this time Dan asked Bill about ways to incorporate technology into his painting, he had asked for a proof of concept. Bill decided to take this opportunity to heart. +

This is also the first painting with the INFO/NFC chip that Dan asked Bill to research.
