> GIVING THANKS!
> 
> Today we would like to give thanks to Andrea and Bill Davison who are amazing volunteers and foster home to many dogs in need.
> 
> Andrea and Bill Davison have been with the rescue for close to 5 years. They initially applied to FBR to adopt but was asked if they would be willing to foster an urgent needs dog. They immediately stepped up and picked up a >terrified pup from HCAS who they named Chance. Since then, they have been dedicated foster parents to 14 boxers (and counting) and are always willing to volunteer their time at events and FBR gatherings.
> 
> Thank you so much for your dedication and willingness to open your heart and home to foster so many dogs in need. Compassionate Care boy Narley has been so blessed to have you for his family and Zoey is loving being with you. Thank you from all of us here at Florida Boxer Rescue. We wouldn't be able to save those that we do without volunteers like you!
