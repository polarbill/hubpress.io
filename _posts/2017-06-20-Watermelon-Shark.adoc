| Title | Watermelon Shark
| Medium | Food (Watermlon)
| Embedded NFC Serial | None
| Provenance | Bill Davison (2017) + 
Given to the Martinez family shortly after +
Trash can some point after that.
| Inspiration | The original goal was for this to be made for a pool/movie birthday party where we would watch Jaws in the pool. Time, resources, and weather cause the delay of the shark, but not the party itself. I decided to make it the following week for another party.
